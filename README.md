# NYC Citibike Analysis

As cities become more and more congested with private vehicles people are looking at alternatives that are convenient, healthy and environmentally friendly. This is why bike sharing is experiencing a boom in big cities such as New York. We intend to draw from this analysis lessons we can apply from Citibikeâ€™s experience in setting up a ride-sharing program in Des Moines Iowa.

## Methodology

Using Tableau and Citibike usage data for August 2019, we will compare information about NY and Des Moines and reveal qualities of Citibike program that could help the Des Moines project succeed. US Census and transportation data will also be collected from the US Census website.
Analysis

## What are the Demographic Characteristics of Des Moines vs NYC?
The first area of analysis is centered on three areas in population, gender and age distribution.
### Population
The biggest area of difference is the population in the same period Des Moines only had a population of 214,237 while New York has a population of 8,336,817. This is despite the difference in land area of 80.9 sqm vs 302.6 sqm for New York City. 
It is clear that any bike sharing system takes into account the population difference in order to come up with an optimal number of bikes and stations.
### Gender
In this area NYC and Des Moines are almost identical. The general population of NYC is 52% female and 48% male. In Des Moines the population is split to 51% female and 49% male.
### Age Distribution
Again in this area NYC and Des Moines are very similar. The distribution of the population between 0-18 is 32%, 18-65 is 57% and over 65 is 12% in Des Moines. In NYC, 0-18 is 28%, 18-65 is 59% and over 65 is 14 %.
## What is the distribution of users based on age and sex and type of user in NYC?
The ride sharing program in NYC is predominantly used by men. Almost, all the riders fall in the 18-65 age group which is incidentally the largest age group in Des Moines as well as NYC. It is also important to note that most riders are regular subscribers and not tourists!
## How are bike riders using Citibike in NYC?
### Peak Riding Hours
There are two peaks in ridership during the August period analyzed. The first is in the morning at around 8 AM and then again at around 5 PM. This most likely has something to do with the heat of the summer since the ridership declines during peak periods of heat. And since the days are long bike riding continues up to around 8 PM.
### Trip Duration by Age
There were a few discrepancies with the data with some riders reporting ages that seem unrealistic (as much as 136 years old!). However the conclusion that can be reached here is that the amount of time spent using the service increase as age goes down.
### Top Start Locations (Placement of Stations)
Top start locations were identified using the mapping feature of Tableau. Most of the rides started in the midtown to downtown area with the 5 stations falling in the area within a few blocks of the river. Other popular locations were near subway stations and popular NYC attractions. In the planning stages, it is important for the investors to identify similar locations in Des Moines to maximize the ridership.
### Possible Locations in Des Moines
Based on the study of attractions in Des Moines here are some areas that can be considered:
- State Capitol
- Science Center of Iowa
- John and Mary Pappajohn Sculpture Park
- Salisbury House and Gardens
- Des Moines Art Center
## Summary and Conclusion
Despite the difference in population most of the important demographic data appears to be similar when NYC and Des Moines is compared. This appears to indicate that the same success is possible although at a much lower scale.
Some of the important considerations include:
1. Placement of stations should be at or near transportation hubs and city attractions as it data points to greatest chance of success when the stations are placed in these locations.
2. Although there are definitely opportunities for use by tourists, data shows that the great majority of the users of bike-sharing are long term residents of the city. Therefore, programs to attract subscribers should be carefully considered and implemented.
